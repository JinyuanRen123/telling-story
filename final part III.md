As an enthusiast in the hospitality industry, my journey into the dynamics of hotel bookings in the United States is driven by a desire to unravel travel patterns, discern preferences, and advocate for sustainable practices within this thriving sector. Armed with insights gained from my internship in the travel domain, I am set to embark on a visual exploration of diverse data sources, including hotel booking platforms and travel databases.

**Changes made since Part II**
I carefully integrated all the feedback and interview insights into my story, emphasizing the importance of delivering valuable information that resonates with my readers. Their perspectives are paramount, and I recognized that the success of my narrative depends on their understanding and acknowledgment of its value.

In terms of overall logic, I restructured the narrative to enhance clarity, drawing on the collaborative input from my interviewees. Their contributions played a pivotal role in refining the storyline and ensuring a more coherent and compelling narrative.

To improve user engagement, I heeded feedback about lengthy paragraphs and strategically broke down sections into shorter, more digestible paragraphs. This adjustment aims to captivate readers' attention and enhance the overall reading experience.

Aesthetic considerations were not overlooked. I made significant revisions to the graphs and overall layout, focusing on visual appeal to create an informative and visually engaging presentation that avoids potential confusion.

In the final checking phase, I conducted a thorough review of grammar and writing style to guarantee a polished and professional piece. Every detail was scrutinized to ensure the story's coherence and effectiveness.

**The audience**
Crafting a persona played a crucial role in shaping the narrative tone of my story, ensuring that I covered all the essential information I aimed to deliver. The feedback obtained from interviews provided valuable insights, allowing me to refine my approach based on potential audience critique. Following the suggestions gathered in part II, I narrowed down my target audience to two specific communities: practitioners in the coffee industry seeking industrial news and trends, and relevant coffee policymakers. This audience is well-acquainted with the subject matter and is eager to gain insights for informed decision-making and strategic planning to navigate industry changes.

By defining a precise target audience, I was able to create a more focused and concise call to action, tailoring my narrative to address the specific needs and interests of my intended viewers.

Recognizing the distinct audiences for my story and the final presentation, I adjusted my approach accordingly. The presentation's audience, comprised of classmates and the professor, had a limited timeframe of one minute. Consequently, I streamlined my narration by eliminating transitional slides and retaining only key visualizations and essential sentences to deliver a succinct and impactful message.

**Final design decisions**

In the initial phase (Part I) of my project, I delineated the storyline, structured the story arc, and identified the charts essential for conveying my narrative. Ensuring an ample supply of relevant data was a priority during this stage.

Moving on to Part II, I delved into the creation of a mood board, personas, textual content, and a Shorthand draft of my story. Concurrently, I conducted interviews to gather constructive suggestions from diverse perspectives.

The subsequent step (Part III) involved meticulous revisions based on the valuable feedback received. I crafted a comprehensive story in preparation for the presentation, incorporating the insights shared by my interviewees. The presentations of my peers during the session provided additional inspiration, prompting me to refine my charts and overall story layout. A notable enhancement was the discovery of new formatting features in Shorthand that proved optimal for presenting geographical regions. Specifically, I utilized Shorthand's dynamic formatting to illustrate the coffee belt on a map, showcasing the precise locations of major coffee-producing regions within it. This method surpassed the effectiveness of traditional map representations, especially considering the limited number of countries involved.

While facing limitations with Flourish, such as the absence of an auxiliary trendline feature and occasional bugs, I adapted by exploring alternative methods to convey the narrative effectively. One noteworthy approach was incorporating a concise takeaway for each chart, contributing to a more streamlined and impactful storytelling process.

**Final thoughts**

In conclusion, the evolution of my data storytelling project has been a dynamic and iterative process, spanning multiple stages. From the initial conceptualization and structuring of the storyline to the meticulous crafting of personas and gathering of suggestions through interviews, each phase played a crucial role in refining the narrative.

The feedback received during the revision stage (Part III) was instrumental in enhancing the clarity and impact of my story. The collaborative nature of the process, incorporating insights from interviews and drawing inspiration from peers' presentations, fostered a more robust and engaging storytelling approach.

Discoveries such as the innovative formatting features in Shorthand for geographical representations and the strategic use of concise takeaways for charts underscored the adaptability required in data storytelling. Overcoming limitations, whether with tools like Flourish or addressing bugs, underscored the importance of flexibility and problem-solving in the storytelling journey.

As the project evolved, I navigated challenges, incorporated feedback, and harnessed newfound insights to shape a compelling narrative. The final product reflects not only the data-driven aspects of the coffee industry but also the collaborative and adaptive nature inherent in the art of storytelling. This journey has deepened my appreciation for the nuances of effective communication through data and has equipped me with valuable skills for future storytelling endeavors.
