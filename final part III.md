# The final data story
[Hotel booking in travel](https://preview.shorthand.com/8Bg1r2BKNXTpu6Xr)

-As an enthusiast in the hospitality industry, my journey into the dynamics of hotel bookings in the United States is driven by a desire to unravel travel   patterns, discern preferences, and advocate for sustainable practices within this thriving sector. Armed with insights gained from my internship in the   travel domain, I am set to embark on a visual exploration of diverse data sources, including hotel booking platforms and travel databases.

# Changes made since Part II
-I carefully integrated all the feedback and interview insights into my story, emphasizing the importance of delivering valuable information that resonates with my readers. Their perspectives are paramount, and I recognized that the success of my narrative depends on their understanding and acknowledgment of its value.

-In terms of overall logic, I restructured the narrative to enhance clarity, drawing on the collaborative input from my interviewees. Their contributions played a pivotal role in refining the storyline and ensuring a more coherent and compelling narrative.

-To improve user engagement, I heeded feedback about lengthy paragraphs and strategically broke down sections into shorter, more digestible paragraphs. This adjustment aims to captivate readers' attention and enhance the overall reading experience.

-Aesthetic considerations were not overlooked. I made significant revisions to the graphs and overall layout, focusing on visual appeal to create an informative and visually engaging presentation that avoids potential confusion.

-In the final checking phase, I conducted a thorough review of grammar and writing style to guarantee a polished and professional piece. Every detail was scrutinized to ensure the story's coherence and effectiveness.

# The audience
-Crafting a persona played a pivotal role in shaping the narrative tone of my story, ensuring that I covered all the essential information for my target audience. Drawing insights from interviews, I refined my approach based on potential audience critique. For Part II, I narrowed down my target audience to two specific groups: budget-conscious travelers and students who are yet to enter the workforce, both seeking affordable hotel booking options.

-By defining this precise target audience, I could create a more focused and concise call to action, tailoring my narrative to address the specific needs and interests of travelers looking for cost-effective accommodation.

-Recognizing the distinct audiences for my story and the final presentation, I adjusted my approach accordingly. For the presentation audience, comprised of classmates and the professor, with a limited timeframe of one minute, I streamlined my narration. This involved eliminating transitional slides and retaining only key visualizations and essential sentences to deliver a succinct and impactful message for budget-conscious travelers and students.
# Final design decisions

-In the initial phase (Part I) of my project, I laid the groundwork by outlining the storyline, structuring the story arc, and identifying key visual elements necessary for conveying the narrative. Ensuring access to pertinent data was a top priority during this stage, focusing on information relevant to the hotel booking domain.

-Transitioning to Part II, I delved into creating a mood board, defining personas, crafting textual content, and generating a Shorthand draft for my hotel booking story. Simultaneously, I conducted interviews to gather constructive suggestions from potential users, refining my approach based on diverse perspectives.

-The subsequent step (Part III) involved meticulous revisions guided by the valuable feedback received. I synthesized a comprehensive story in preparation for the presentation, incorporating insights shared by interviewees. Peer presentations during the session served as additional inspiration, prompting me to enhance my visualizations and overall story layout. Notably, I discovered new formatting features in Shorthand, optimizing the presentation of geographical regions. Leveraging Shorthand's dynamic formatting, I effectively illustrated the distribution of budget-friendly hotels on a map, offering a more engaging and informative experience compared to traditional representations.

-Despite encountering limitations with tools like Flourish, such as the absence of an auxiliary trendline feature and occasional bugs, I adapted by exploring alternative methods to convey the narrative effectively. One notable strategy was incorporating concise takeaways for each chart, contributing to a more streamlined and impactful storytelling process tailored to the hotel booking audience.
