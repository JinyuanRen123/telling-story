**revise based on interviews**
Changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified：

I dedicated a more comprehensive section in the visualization to highlight specific eco-friendly practices adopted by accommodations, providing detailed insights for environmentally conscious travelers.
Redesigned Property Types Pie Chart. I explored more visually appealing alternatives for presenting property types, considering a format that is both informative and visually engaging.
Visual Appeal and Engagement. I incorporated more visually appealing elements throughout the visualization, ensuring that data is presented in a way that captures the audience's attention and maintains engagement.
Changed the bubble chart to a bar chart, so people can see the top 10 most popular places quickly. And I added some text and titles to each chart to avoid being too concised.
