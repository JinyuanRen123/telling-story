**Step 1: choose a data visualization from MakeoverMonday**
I chose the dataset called The cheapest way to get your protein, and here is the source link: (https://data.world/makeovermonday/2023w8)

**Step 2:critique the data visualization**
I can give the data visualization I selected 85 points out of 100. The graph missed the cost data, it can be ambiguous by targeting the cost with y-axis only. If we can make the chart more specific, we can divide the chart into three groups with three different colors like vegetarians, meat-only, and normal. Change the layout of the columns from vertical to horizontal. And we can delete the sub-title here because it occupied too much space and useless. 
Usefulness, Completeness: 8 points out of 10. Perceptibility: 6. Truthfulness, Intuitiveness， Aesthetics： 10. Engagement：9.
The Cheapest Ways to Get Your Protein has a very good presentation by using histograms and sort the costs from the highest to the lowest, along with the icons. So, we can clearly understand the items and to pick the one the audience like the most. The disadvantages here are the columns don't show the exact data like how much should people pay for the items, and the data at the columns are calories which are unrelated to the topic here, so it can make the audience feel confused. I may clear the calories data to make the graph clearer and lighting the highest and the lowest columns in another color and give the real price above the bars.  

**Step 3: sketch out a solution**
Here is my sketch: <div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1699997161319' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Cost for protein ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;sk&#47;sketchforhw34&#47;1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='sketchforhw34&#47;1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;sk&#47;sketchforhw34&#47;1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='zh-CN' /></object></div>                
<script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1699997161319');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

**Step four: Test the solution**
student A, mid 20's, female.
I think it's about the costs for different groups of people who wanna get protein. I'm confused about the exact price of different items if I want to pick one because there is no price data here. Also, you should give a limit amount of protein, like if people want to get 1 kg peotein, how much they should pay. This can make sure no other variables here can confuse the comparing rule. I think this data visualization faces people who have tight budget. I wanna give an average line here to highlight the bar. And I prefer to give some different colors to seperate different target groups.
student B, mid 20's, male.
I like the descending order here showing the cheapest and the most expensive items we can pick. However, 1'm confused about the price, even if you tell me which is the cheapest and which is the most expensive, I still feel worried if Iwant to make a budget schedule. Like me, I'm a vegan, so I don't eat meat or eggs, which item should I choose to get my protein? I have to sort these items again, so it could be better if you can seperate these tems into vegans and vegetarians. I think your graph is facing a broader size, so you should make it clearer for people who can click icons by themself to get a specific rank.
Summary
I would make it clearer like who I am talking to. I will group the data into vegans and vegetarians, also set a yes or no icons beside to buld a specific rank. The title here need to be more careful and I will add like 30g to limit the amount of protein, this can be unbiased when people want to make a comparasion. A specific price data is also necessary here and I need to show it to people. Adding an average line could be better.Make some colors different can avoid aesthetic fatigue.

**Step five: Build your solution**
I followed the tutorial video and made some new changes base on that. Here is the referance link: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fsv56097MU)
And here is my work:
<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1699998845866' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='cost for protein ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;hw&#47;hw34_16999785449300&#47;costforprotein&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='hw34_16999785449300&#47;costforprotein' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;hw&#47;hw34_16999785449300&#47;costforprotein&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='zh-CN' /></object></div>                
<script type='text/javascript'>                    
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1699998845866');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='1366px';
                                       vizElement.style.height='795px';
                                      } else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='1366px';vizElement.style.height='795px';
                                                                                 } else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='1077px';
                                                                                        }                     var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');
scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

This could include people who are budget-conscious, students, athletes on a tight budget, or anyone looking for cost-effective ways to meet their protein needs. No. Because the graph is too concise and ignores many other conditions for a broader audience. For example, people who are vegetarians with low budget, can't choose chicken breast or eggs. They need to pick one item by exclusive method, which can be troublesome. Therefore, it would be better if we could sort people into different types, and then make a histogram according to different groups. Finally, I add a navigation in my dashboard which is linked to my data sheet, and a download button is under the navigation as well.
