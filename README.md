# portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU! Here's where all my cool work will go. You should probably hire me.

# about me
Hi! I really like data. And I like visualizations. So I guess you can say that I like data visualizations!
My linkedin: linkedin.com/in/lillianren

# what I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. Maybe I want to make a list of all the things. If so, I can do so in Markdown like this:
good competence of story telling
skills in data visualization
how to interact with audience

# examples
wait for a while
